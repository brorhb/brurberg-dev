I'll be the n-th person to write a little recap of 2020. 2020 has been an interesting year 🤨 on a big scale it was a pretty bad year, but for me personally it has been pretty great honestly. So I just want to take a few moments to appreciate what I have, and why 2020 wasn't so bad for me personally 🙃</p><p>First this first, work. I changed up by workplace. Resulting in more variation in my tasks and what I work on. I now work at a consultancy called Variant, but you can read more about that in my previous post. In short, I'm happy with my switching and I'm still talking to former colleagues at EcoOnline, but now as friends and not colleagues 🙈</p><p>Second. I don't enjoy team sports, so my hobbies have not been afflicted by Covid. My hobbies mainly consists of mountain biking 🚵‍♀️ and snowboarding 🏂 I also do cross country skiing ⛷ but that's more of a cardio workout thing I do 🤪 So all summer I was able to go on bike rides, and when the autumn came around I bought a season pass at the local resort. So my life have been mostly work, home renovations and snowboarding the last month.</p><p>Moving to a shredtown is what really enabled me to do all this. Moving to Oppdal in 2019 is probably to date the best decision I've ever made 🥲</p><p>I'm also pretty new in town so most of my social life revolve around a few people, so keeping my interactions to a minimum of people have been quite easy as well. 2019 also set me up very good for working at home and away from my colleagues. I'm very happy I had this experience under my belt this year! I know remote working and home office is not for everybody, but I hope this year allows the people that can make it work, to do it more. And maybe do the same thing I did and move out of the city 🌃 I promise, it's a sweet lifestyle 🤘🏻</p><p>So to wrap this up, let's hope that 2021 brings more of the good things from 2020, and less of the bad from 2020.</p><p>Happy holidays 🥳</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><footer class="pv4 ph3 ph5-m ph6-l mid-gray"><div class="f6 db tc">© 2020 Bror Brurberg All Rights Reserved</div><div class="pv4 ph3 ph5-m ph6-l mid-gray f6 db tc">Generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a>.
