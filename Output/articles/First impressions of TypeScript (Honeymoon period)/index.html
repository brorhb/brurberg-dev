I got some time to work some more on the mobile application I made during my degree.</p><p>This project is perfect for trying out some new technology. I know the codebase, since I wrote it all. I have some metrics over errors coming for Sentry.io, and the project is written in React Native.</p><p>From Sentry I know that most of my errors that end in a fatal crash has its origin from some sort of <code>TypeError</code>. This combined with my new born passion for Swift pushed me into trying TypeScript. And so far I find it really useful in a couple of ways, even some unexpected ways too.</p><p>For starters, I hopefully have less TypeErrors now after switching some components. I’ve started in the small, and my project supports both TypeScript and regular JavaScript. This way I can convert the project component by component. I am supposed to create a new feature, and this is the first component to receive the facelift. The next is my biggest list component, that is also spawning the most errors.</p><p>Most of the TypeErrors is starting to vanish, because of TypeScript interfaces. A interface describe what an Object should be including, and what types the attributes should be. I’ve been creating interfaces for a couple of arrays of objects that I receive from an API. Creating the interface also lets my editor suggest my next dot-notation down in the object, shrinking the chance of a good’ol typo. I’ve also been able to single out a couple of data-points that have been moved in a newer version of the API, also fixing some minor problems for some users where some information did not show.</p><p>One unexpected positive thing note also releated to API stuff. Changes can happen alot on the API-side, especially on alpha and beta levels. My colleague recently asked me “What information from API X do you use?”, before it was kind of hard to tell him, I had to skim trough the code. After TypeScript, I know exactly what I use, where I use it and what I use it for. I did not foresee this outcome.</p><p>As a summary; I’m in my honeymoon period with TypeScript in combo with React Native. But as of now, I really like it! I get kind of the best of both worlds. As a lone mobile developer, I can develop fast for multiple platforms with React Native, and now I can develop a bit safer and with less errors although a little bit slower, because TypeScript challenges me to really think trough a feature or function in a way I did not before.</p></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
