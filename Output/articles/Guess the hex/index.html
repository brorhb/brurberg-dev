Soooooo, during lunch today I started to mock it up using Flutter 💙</p><iframe id="twitter-widget-0" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" style="position: static; visibility: visible; display: block; width: 500px; height: 2015px; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: 10px auto; max-width: 100%; min-width: 220px;" data-tweet-id="1205982293787103234" title="Twitter Tweet"></iframe><p>So after working on it for 30min during lunch 🥗 and a couple of hours when I got home, this is what I got 😅</p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2048/1*OSW5yNYyRwXZICiym3ctjw.png"/><p>I was a fun little project, and might be the closest I’ve done to “speed-coding”, but instead of making an interesting UI like those speed-coders do, I tried to make some logic to go with my simple UI 🤓 I was a fun challenge, and I got to work with things I usually don’t work with, I usually don’t work with colors, especially in this way 🎨</p><p>So to the code! The logic I fairly simpel. I needed a GameState and I like to work with the <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/provider">Provider package</a> 📦 so I went with that package, since I tried to do this quick. I also needed streams in this app, so I just added <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/rxdart">RxDart</a> right away. So my main state will be held in the GameState class with a ChangeNotifier, but since I want the win state and error state to be easier to listen to, I made those parts as streams. I’m sure there is a more effective way, but hey — this is me trying new stuff 👀</p><p>So what do I have in my state holder class? (I won’t post the whole thing, just pseudo code).</p><iframe src="https://medium.com/media/e8a06e52b62295416544a54a61639d02" frameborder=0></iframe><p>This is the engine that makes this app work 😅 It’s not much, but it is enough.</p><p>But… I have one problem with Provider. I have not found a good way to listen for a change, and then spawn a SnackBar og AlertDialog. That is why I added some streams to this mess 😁 With the streams, I can set up something like this:</p><iframe src="https://medium.com/media/bc2b3e3961e32dbeadef02ccfea9200d" frameborder=0></iframe><p>I’m sure there is another solution to the Future.delayed(Duration.zero, () {}); hack, but it works 😅 I haven't combined ChangeNotifier with streams like this before, but now I can come up with a couple of use-cases in my productions app 😁</p><p>Today I also learned about CIEDE2000 as a way to calculate the distance between two colors. Of course I did not do this myself, but I wanted to know a bit of how it works, and I was pleasantly surprised that there was a Dart package for this (uploaded 9.dec 2019! Just my luck 🎅) called <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/delta_e">delta_e</a>!</p><p>I also had to create an extension to Color, so I could take a string and try to create a color from it credit to this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50081213/how-do-i-use-hexadecimal-color-strings-in-flutter">post</a> for explaining how to create a color from hex and visa versa. I just added a Exception to it if the input is totally invalid and some generic error…</p><iframe src="https://medium.com/media/2891c6bfca27a88e8f185283f609a784" frameborder=0></iframe><p>This was a short one, but I had fun writing this app, and I actually learned something I can take with me into my production apps. I think this is why playing and having fun with something is important to improve 😁 I hope you got something out of reading this, maybe you want to create this app too? 👀🎨</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
