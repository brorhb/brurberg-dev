I'm back at my office 😁 I did not want to write anything about Covid but it's too big to not make its way into Alain's every part of your life... this is not a post about the pandemic, but more about what things I'm taking with me when we slowly return back to normal.</p><p>To be honest. Covid haven't really effected me to much. But I have changed some parts of my life. First change is media.</p><p>I've changed some parts about how I consume news. Bfc (before Covid) I read all newspapers, and used them for entertainment. Now I read them for info, and I only read one paper (NRK.no) that is state funded. Why? Because I know they don't need sensational headlines to get clicks to earn ad revenue. Nrk don't have ads, and don't make money from clicks. That way I get only relevant news as plain I can get them.</p><p>I have also changed when I read news. Bfc I read news multiple times trough the day. Feeling like it was a "productive" entertainment channel. But if you read about something bad all day every day, you will be depressed. I started reading news only in the morning and once in the evening. Instead of reading news as last thing before going to sleep, I now play some Animal Crossing as a mental health exercise 😅</p><p>Work also changed a bit. Not much tho to be honest. I have stable income, and have a job that did not really get affected by Covid. Bfc I worked in a office solution as stated in earlier posts. When my country shut down, I moved my stuff home, and created a little home office for my self😁 Now I'm back at the office solution, but I have changed some things. Mostly a mental thing 😅 I now find it easier to work outside me office, and can now start my day at home and do tasks like email and figure out what I should do during the day before I go to the office. This way I get a nice little break both mental and physically before moving into heavier theoretical work😋</p><p>I want to continue with my new way of consuming news going forward, and I'm glad I now find it easier to work in multiple locations 😊 and I guess that's the best we can do, learn something about your self, and become a better you. So that you can come back from Covid as a better version of yourself🤓 I know it's cliché, but try to think about it. Have this situation brought something good into your routine and/or life? Focus on that😁 I hope you all are healthy and safe ✌🏼 try to stay active and think about something else from time to time 🤷‍♂️</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><footer class="pv4 ph3 ph5-m ph6-l mid-gray"><div class="f6 db tc">© 2020 Bror Brurberg All Rights Reserved</div><div class="pv4 ph3 ph5-m ph6-l mid-gray f6 db tc">Generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a>.
