Where I live (in Norway), a lot of basic infrastructure have now shut down. And for the last week, I have been working on another free app. It's not much, but it might help with remembering to wash you hands. But this is a little thing I can do to help someone out there.</p><p>I have seen similar apps on iOS that does this, but this is spesifically for your Apple Watch. When you install the app, you can go into settings, and set a range you want to be remembered within. Also set the interval you want to be remembered at.</p><p>I work from home, so I've set my timer to nag me between 0900 and 2100. It notifies me every 3 hours. When you open the app, you can tap the "Wash" button. This sets of a timer for 20 seconds, and you watch will vibrate and make a sound(if your watch is not in silent mode. It will always vibrate) telling you you have washed for the recommended amount of time. If your app is closed it will trigger a notification for when you are done.</p><p>I've submitted this app to the AppStore and will update this when it's live along side a new post when its live</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><footer class="pv4 ph3 ph5-m ph6-l mid-gray"><div class="f6 db tc">Â© 2020 Bror Brurberg All Rights Reserved</div><div class="pv4 ph3 ph5-m ph6-l mid-gray f6 db tc">Generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a>.
