The Swift community is awesome, and people do all sorts of exciting stuff! A big influencer and personality in this community is [John Sundell](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/). He have also created a full suite of tools to help you create a static sites like this one with swift 😍

 [This is the tool](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish) responsible for this. It caused me some frustration since it’s not documented too well. I will not expand in detail how I built my site, but I will give you a link to my [repo](https://github.com/brorhb/brurberg-dev) so you can have a little peak for your self 🙈
