short: The first of september this year, my girlfriend and I moved. We bought a house in the town of Oppdal, and moved there from TÃ¸nsberg. TÃ¸nsberg hosts the main offices for EcoOnline, the company I work for, and you might have guessed it: They donâ€™t have any offices in OppdalðŸ˜… Or, as a matter of fact, they have one small 9m2 cell in a building there now. This is my office. It is in a building with more offices, mostly for remote workers or locals with small businesses. And now, I am one of those remote workers.

# Working remotely: Part 1

The first of september this year, my girlfriend and I moved. We bought a house in the town of Oppdal, and moved there from TÃ¸nsberg. TÃ¸nsberg hosts the main offices for EcoOnline, the company I work for, and you might have guessed it: They donâ€™t have any offices in OppdalðŸ˜… Or, as a matter of fact, they have one small 9m2 cell in a building there now. This is my office. It is in a building with more offices, mostly for remote workers or locals with small businesses. And now, I am one of those remote workers.

Iâ€™ve been a remote worker for about a month now, and already I have some experiences Iâ€™d like to share. This could be useful information for other fresh remote workers, and for people working with remote resources.

I know other people have talked about this, but I feel itâ€™s still very valid. Communication, one simple thing humans do every day is actually the hardest. I feel the thing that makes this hard is that you canâ€™t just drop by someone on the way to the coffee machine. I have to relay on tools like slack, teams, iMessage and email. And I have to change it up to where I think the receiver is most likely to see my message, and respond to it.

Another thing that is a thing to look out for is: Remember to take break! this week has been quite hectic for me. I arrive at the office at 0700 in the morning and I start working around 15 minutes after that. The next time I look at the watch its 1300 and I havenâ€™t eaten lunch yet. Remember to watch the time and take breaks. This came more naturally for me when working at the office with my colleagues. We have a ping-pong table, you have the office banter and more distractions. This might not be good for productivity, but it helps you to take breaks ðŸ˜…

Also to help with the break part. If you are like me, when you solve a problem you just kind of forget that if you find yourself stuck on another problem an hour later. And you feel like you canâ€™t take a break now because you Â«havenâ€™t done anything today!Â». I just forget about those 10 other things Iâ€™ve done trough out the day. So to battle this, Iâ€™m using a journal. When I solve an issue, fix a bug finish a section in a course; I jot it down into the bullet-list for the day. I create a new list for each day, and this really helps! If I feel like I havenâ€™t done anything, I just take a glance at my list and I can quickly remind myself of the other things Iâ€™ve done.

Lastly; Should you work remotely? Well, I canâ€™t really answer that, but you can! You know with yourself if you can work alone. I know I can, I show up at the office at 0700 and leave somewhere between 15â€“1600. I do have the self discipline to get work done without anyone Â«watchingÂ» me. If youâ€™re not sure about yourself, I guess you could try to work from home a couple of days and see what you can get done.

At lastâ€¦ I promise this time. As mentioned I do work in an office. I think this is very different from working from home. I have to get up in the moring, get dressed and get to the office, and when I leave the office I leave the work at the office. Iâ€™ve talked to people working from home, and this is a hard part for them. They donâ€™t have to get dressed in the morning and work is so close to your personal life. Itâ€™s easier to work for longer into the evening on a problem since work is home, and home is work. With having an actual office, I have created a sort of barrier between work and free time.

I think this will be a multipart series, and if so this will be part 1.
