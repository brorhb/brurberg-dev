During the day I write code. During the evenings and nights I do renovation work at home, I play golf and I do mountain biking 🚵‍♀️

I just started mountain biking, but I'm not totally fresh to bikes... I was really into bikes as a kid, and transitioned into bmx and skateboarding in my teens. I have been snowboarding since I was five, so I'm no stranger to know what to do when stuff goes rough 😅 I'm not very good, but I thought I should embed a little video

Staying active is really important for me, and it really helps my mental health 😁 Especially now when we spend more time at home then normal 👀 Getting out of the house feels good, and adds to the feeling of accomplishment during the day. I know I do what some would call extreme sports (except golf 🏌️‍♂️), but going for a hike, a bike ride or any form of workout does the trick 🤓 So! Stay active peeps, this might be the time to try something new 🎉
